# THavalon
An extended ruleset for the Resistance: Avalon 

## Roles

### Good (Loyal Servants of Arthur) 
The goal of Good players is to have three missions succeed, and then have Merlin and the Lovers survive the Assassination round. 

#### Merlin 
Merlin's role is largely unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They are shown a list of players with Evil roles, as detailed below. 

- Merlin correctly sees players with the following Evil roles as Evil: Maelegant, Morgana, Agravaine, Colgrevance, Oberon. 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Good roles as Evil: Lancelot 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Evil role as Good: Mordred 

Merlin is a valid target for Assassination. 

#### Percival
Percival's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They know which players have the Merlin or Morgana roles, but not which role is possessed by each player. 

- Percival correctly sees Merlin as Merlin
- Percival incorrectly sees Morgana as Merlin 

#### Tristan and Iseult 
Tristan and Iseult ("The Lovers") are two good roles that provide their associated players with the knowledge that the other is also Good. 

The Lovers are a valid target for Assassination.  

#### Guinevere and Lancelot
Guinevere and Lancelot (commonly referred to as "weak lovers") are two good roles that provide their associated players with knowledge about both the other person and Maelegant (an Evil role). To make matters worse, Merlin will incorrectly perceive Lancelot as Evil. 

- Guinevere sees Maelegant and Lancelot.
- Lancelot sees Maelegant and Guinvere, and is also perceived to be Evil by Merlin. 

#### Arthur 
Arthur is the only Good character to possess an activated ability. Arthur knows which other good roles are present in the game, but has no information about which players possess any of the roles present. Furthermore, Arthur has an ability, called Redemption, which allows Good one final chance at victory. 

##### Ability: Redemption 
If three of the first four missions fail, the player who has the Arthur role may formally declare as Arthur. You may, after consulting the other players, attempt to identify all evil players in the game. If you are correct, then the assassination round occurs as if three missions had succeeded; should the evil team fail to assassinate a viable target, the good team wins.

### Evil (Minions of Mordred) 
The goal of Evil players is to have either three missions fail, or should Good have won, assassinate either Merlin or the Lovers.
