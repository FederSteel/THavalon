# THavalon
An extended ruleset for the Resistance: Avalon, primarily developed by me (Andrew Hitt/aquadrizzt), with help and extensive play-testing from Technology House, Inc. 

## What is THavalon? 
THavalon is a massive extension of the rules presented in Don Eskridge's social deception game, The Resistance: Avalon. The main point of THavalon is to provide every player of the game with a role and that to ensure every player in the game feels like they can make an impact on the result of the game. Over time, these rules have evolved in an effort to make the game both faster and more fun, as well as to fix some of the playstyles that have been established in our own metagame. 

While you are welcome to pick and choose from the new rules, abilities, and roles listed below, the game is balanced under the assumption that you are using all of these rules simultaneously. However, at the end of the day, you're playing a board game to have fun (hopefully), so feel free to use these rules in whatever way you think would enhance you and your gaming group's experience. 

Comments, criticisms, ideas, and suggestions are all always welcome. I'd love to hear any feedback that people have to offer. 

## New Rules 
These rules are in addition to the rules presented in the official rulebook. If a rule here and a rule in the rulebook are contradictory, use the rules here. 

### Team Building Phase 
These rule changes are designed to speed up the game and to encourage more thoughtful choices about Approving or Rejecting a mission proposal. 

#### First Round Proposals 
The way Teams are proposed on the First round is slightly different than the rest of the game. Instead of five proposals which are each voted on sequentially, there are only two proposals for the first round. After everyone has seen their role information, two players are selected at random (with a third player chosen to begin the 2nd round). 

These two players each propose a team of the appropriate number of people for the first Round (2 for games of 5, 6 or 7 players, 3 for games of 8, 9 or 10 players). Everyone then votes, with Approve representing a vote for the first person's proposal and Reject representing a vote for the second person's proposal. In case of a tie, the Team proposed by the person farther in the proposal order from the person who begins the 2nd round is chosen to go on the Quest. 

In an effort to make this balanced, there is to be absolutely no substantive discussion (e.g. "oh where *is* my Fail card?", "this should succeed right?", etc.) prior to all Quest cards being played. 

After the results of the 1st Quest are revealed, play begins with the person randomly selected to have the first proposal of the 2nd Round. 

#### Proposals per Round
The number of proposals in each Round is now equal to one more than the number of Evil roles in the game. 

- In 5 and 6 player games, there will be 3 proposals per round. 
- In 7, 8, and 9 player games, there will be 4 proposals per round. 
- In 10 player games, there will be 5 proposals per round. 

#### Force
The last proposal of a round is no longer voted on; the Leader may choose any Team they want, and that Team is automatically considered to have been approved, as if by a majority of players voting Approve. (This replaces the rule where Evil wins if five Teams are rejected in a single round.) 

In games with 7 or more players, the Force proposal is also susceptible to the Evil team's Hijack ability, except when two missions have already Failed. (Note: This ability basically ensures that the first time a mission proposal gets to Force, it will Fail one way or another.) 

##### Team Ability: Hijack 
A random Evil player other than Mordred is given this ability at the start of the game. They may use this ability in addition to all of their other abilities. 

Starting on the second Round, if there are less than 2 failed Quests and the mission is sent via Force, the Evil player who has this ability may formally declare as Evil to replace one person on the mission team with themselves. This ability is only usable once per game, and the player with this ability is not required to use this ability even if the conditions are met. 

#### Inquisition
Inquisition is a new mechanic to encourage players to consider voting for earlier proposals in a round. Inquisition has two varieties: "Strong", and "Weak". Both Strong and Weak Inquisition provide the Leader of the Team with powerful information gathering abilities during the Quest Phase. 

When Inquisition is in effect, players on the Team select the Quest card they wish to play and place it face down in front of them (or another way of signalling that their decision has been made), but the cards are not immediately shuffled together. 

In the case of Strong Inqusition, which only happens should a majority of players vote Approve for the first Team proposal of a Round with 5 Team proposals (e.g. only in 10 player games if using all other rules presented here). Strong Inquisition requires the Leader to choose between two options: 1) remove a player's card but not reveal it, or 2) reveal a player's card. All other Quest cards are then shuffled together and revealed as per usual.  

Weak Inquisition only happens if 1) a majority of players vote Approve for the second Team proposal of a Round with 5 Team proposals, or 2) a majority of players vote Approve for the first Team proposal of a Round with 4 Team proposals. Weak Inquisition requires the Leader to choose a player's card to reveal. All other Quest cards are then shuffled together and revealed as per usual.  

Cards that are revealed but not removed by either Inquisition effect still affect the results of the mission. The Leader is allowed to use Inquisition on their own Quest card if they so desire, but they must use the ability (e.g. the Leader cannot choose to not use Inquisition if it has been earned). 

Strong Inquisition and Weak Inquisition can each only occur once per game. If Strong Inquisition has already been used that game, and the first Team proposal of a Round is sent (which would normally earn Strong Inquisition), the Leader is considered to have gained the Weak Inquisition ability instead.

### Quest Phase 
There are only two changes to the Quest Phase, one of which is explained in the Inquisition section (under Team Building Phase, above). 

#### Reversal 
In most games of THavalon, players who are sent on Quests will receive three Quest cards instead of two. The additional card is a Reversal, and is only playable by players who have the Lancelot and Maelegant roles. 

When played, a Reversal inverts the result of the mission. Two Reversals cancel each other out. If there is at least one Fail card played along with a single Reversal, the mission is considered to have succeeded. If there are no Fail cards and a single Reversal, the mission is considered to have failed. 

For Quests that require 2 Fails to be considered a failed Quest, there is a slight caveat as explained below. In most cases, a Reversal on a 2-Fails-required Quests behaves as expected, excluding the circumstance in which a single Reversal is played with no Fail cards (which would be expected to count as a Fail). 

- If a single Reversal and no Fails are played, the Quest is considered to have *succeeded*.  
- If a single Reversal and a single Fail are both played, the Quest is considered to have failed. 
- If a single Reversal and two or more Fails are played, the Quest is considered to have succeeded. 

#### Questing Beast Was Here 
In 9 player games, there are two roles added, one of which has its own Quest card. The player assigned the Questing Beast role in the game is required to play "Questing Beast Was Here" cards whenever they are sent on missions; they may not play any other Quest card. This is to aid the player with the Pelinor role in identifying the Questing Beast. Other than being conspicuous, Questing Beast Was Here cards function identically to Success cards in terms of mission results. 

### Assassination Phase 
The Assassination Phase remains largely unchanged, but there are several new options for Evil to choose from when identifying the person(s) they wish to Assassinate. Should the Good team fulfill any of their win conditions, the Evil team is allowed to choose one of the following three Assassination options.

- Assassinating a single person as Merlin. 
- Assassinating two people as the Lovers (Tristan and Iseult). 
- Assassinating no one. 

#### Optional: Weaker Assassination
If your group feels that Assassination is too powerful or too effective, consider playing with this set of limitations on Assassination. 

In games with fewer than 7 players, Evil is welcome to discuss amongst themselves, but at the end of discussion, the ranking Assassin (e.g. the person who appears first in this list: Mordred, Morgana, Maelegant, Agravaine, Colgrevance, Oberon) makes the final decision of who to Assassinate. 

In games with more than 7 players, the ability of the Evil team to discuss depends on how many missions Failed prior to three missions Succeeding. 

- 0 missions failed: Each Evil player states their role. The ranking Assassin then chooses an Assassination target with no discussion or input from the rest of Evil. 
- 1 mission failed: Each Evil player states their role and who they think should be Assassinated. The ranking Assassin then chooses an Assassination target with no further discussion or input from the rest of Evil. 
- 2 missions failed: Each Evil player states their role. Evil is then welcome to discuss who they believe should be Assassinated, with the ranking Assassin making the final decision. 

Evil is considered to have won if they correctly identify Merlin, they correctly identify both of the two Lovers, or they choose to assassinate no one and there is neither a Merlin nor a pair of Lovers in the game.

## Roles
In addition to the new rules listed above, THavalon offers almost a dozen new or reworked roles. It should be noted that not all roles listed here will be in any given game. There will always be the appropriate number of Good and Evil roles for the number of players in the game, but beyond that the roles present are randomized. This means that for roles that see a list of other roles, there is no guarantee that they will see as many people as expected. For example, Percival may only see one person, and they must then determine whether that person is Merlin or Morgana. It is also possible for someone to see no one; if there is neither a Merlin nor a Morgana, Percival will only be aware that neither of these roles are present in the current game. 

The only time that roles are guaranteed to be in the game is during 9 player games; both Pelinor and the Questing Beast roles are guaranteed to appear in 9 player games.

### Good (Loyal Servants of Arthur) 
The goal of Good players is to have three missions succeed, and then have Merlin and the Lovers survive the Assassination round. 

#### Merlin 
Merlin's role is largely unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They are shown a list of players with Evil roles, as detailed below. 

- Merlin correctly sees players with the following Evil roles as Evil: Maelegant, Morgana, Agravaine, Colgrevance, Oberon. 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Good roles as Evil: Lancelot 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Evil role as Good: Mordred 

Merlin is a valid target for Assassination. 

#### Percival
Percival's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They know which players have the Merlin or Morgana roles, but not which role is possessed by either player. 

- Percival sees Merlin and Morgana, indistinguishably. 

#### Tristan and Iseult 
Tristan and Iseult ("The Lovers") are two Good roles that know each other as Good. 

The Lovers are a valid target for Assassination.  

#### Lancelot 
Lancelot is a Good role that is allowed to play Reversal cards. They are provided no other information, and they appear Evil to Merlin. 

#### Guinevere 
Guinevere is a Good role who knows about other role relationships present in the game. Guinevere is given two pieces of information ("rumors") of the form "A knows something about B". It is up to Guinevere to make sense of this cryptic information. 

Guinevere's truths can include any of the following: 
- Percival seeing Merlin or Morgana
- Merlin seeing Evil (except for Mordred) 
- Merlin seeing Lancelot 
- Tristan and Iseult seeing each other
- Evil (other than Mordred) seeing other Evil (other than Mordred or Oberon) 
- Oberon seeing Evil (except for Mordred) 
- Arthur knowing about a role's presence

In addition to the correct information provided, Guinevere is also given a single piece of completely false information (e.g. a relationship between two unlinked players). 

In conclusion, Guinevere is given one truth and one lie. 

It is important to note that Guinevere will never see any information about Mordred (true or false) of any form. If there is a Mordred, Guinevere will have no rumors that point from or towards that person. 

#### Arthur 
Arthur is a Good role that knows which other good roles are present in the game, but has no information about which players possess any of the roles present. Furthermore, Arthur has an ability, called Proclamation, which allows Good to rally pending their imminent loss.  
Arthur only appears in games with at least 7 players. 

##### Ability: Proclamation 
After two Quests have Failed, you may (but are not required to) formally declare as Arthur, establishing you as a Good player for the remainder of the game. You may still propose teams, vote on proposals, and be selected to go on Quests, as usual. You may use this ability at any point in the game after two Quests have Failed.

#### Titania
Titania is a Good role who interferes with the information of a random Evil player. Titania is also provided two minor pieces of information: 1) the role of the Evil player whose information they messed up; and 2) whether there is an Oberon in the game. Players whose role information is affected by an Titania are told that their information has been corrupted. 

Titania only appears in games with at least 7 players. 

- Titania can affect any Evil role. 
- Evil roles other than Colgrevance are simply shown one additional person in their list of Evil players. 
- Colgrevance loses information about the role of one random Evil player. 

#### Gawain 
Gawain is a Good role who is provided no information but can intervene on certain missions to potentially change the outcome.

Gawain can only appear in games with 10 players. 

##### Ability: Suspend
Once per game, on either the 2nd mission (always) or the 3rd mission (if the first two missions had different outcomes, e.g. 1 Successful mission and 1 Failed mission), if Gawain is not on the mission team, they may formally declare as Gawain after mission cards have been selected (and potentially Inquisitioned) but before they are shuffled and revealed. Gawain may then collect all mission cards, excluding the mission leader's, shuffle them, examine them, and pick one card to remove. The mission leader's card and remaining cards are then shuffled together and the cards revealed as per usual. 

The next time Gawain is on a mission, they must play the card they removed on a previous mission, even if they normally could not play that card (e.g. Reversal or Fail). 

This ability has lots of interaction with other mechanics. Rulings for certain scenarios are as follows: 
- If the current mission team does not contain the mission leader, a Gawain using the Suspend ability may look at all cards played on that mission and remove one. 
- If Titania attempts to suspend Agravaine's Fail card (e.g. the Agravaine player is one of the people whose card Gawain can Suspend, and there is only one Fail among that set of cards), Agravaine may declare to cause the mission to Fail regardless. If Agarvaine does this, Gawain is **not** required to play a Fail card on the next mission they are on. 
- Gawain cannot look at or Suspend a card that has already been removed via Strong Inquisition. 

In 10 player games, players are expected to assume there is a Gawain (e.g. choosing the Quest card they wish to play and making it clear which card they have chosen to play for that Quest) for the 2nd and 3rd missions, even if they don't know if Gawain is present. This is to preserve the surprise of the Gawain declaration. 

### Evil (Minions of Mordred) 
The goal of Evil players is to have either three missions fail, or should Good have won, assassinate either Merlin or the Lovers. 

#### Mordred
Mordred's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. Mordred knows other Evil players (except Colgrevance), and other Evil players know that they are also Evil.  Furthermore, Mordred is also not seen by Merlin. 

#### Morgana 
Morgana's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. Morgana knows other Evil players (except Colgrevance), and other Evil players know that they are also Evil.  Furthermore, Morgana is also seen incorrectly by Percival as Merlin. 

##### Ability: Sorceress 
Whenever Morgana has a proposal that is not the last proposal of the round (e.g. they do not have Force), they may declare as Morgana and reverse team proposal order for the rest of the game. The remaining proposals for the current round are granted to the people sitting next to the person who proposed the first team of the round (if proposals are typically made clockwise, it begins with the person to the right of the first proposer; if proposals are typically made counterclockwise, it begins with the person to the left of the first proposer). Proposals then proceed counterclockwise (if originally clockwise), or clockwise (if originally counterclockwise). 

Morgana using this ability counts as one of the proposals for their round. 

#### Maelegant 
Maelegant is an Evil role that is allowed to play Reversal cards. Maelegant knows other Evil players (except Colgrevance), and other Evil players know that they are also Evil. 

#### Oberon
Oberon is a Evil role who interferes with the information of a random Good player. Oberon is significantly changed from base rules, in that they know other Evil players (except Colgrevance), and other Evil players know that they are also Evil. Players whose role information is affected by an Oberon are told that their information has been corrupted. 

- Oberon can affect any Good role except Lancelot, Titania, and Gawain. 
- Merlin is shown one additional person who is neither Evil nor Lancelot.
- Percival is shown one additional person who is neither Merlin nor Morgana. 
- Tristan and Iseult are shown one additioanl person who is not their Lover. 
- Arthur is shown one additional random Good role that is not in the game. 
- Guinevere loses half of one of their rumors (e.g. "A sees B" might turn into "??? sees B" or "A sees ???".) 

#### Agravaine 
Agravaine is an Evil role that can force missions they go on to Fail. In addition to knowing the other visible Evil roles (e.g. all Evil except Oberon), Agravaine can cause any mission they are on to Fail, even if it would have succeeded. Agravaine knows other Evil players (except Colgrevance), and other Evil players know that they are also Evil. 

##### Ability: Betrayal 
After mission cards have been revealed, if the Quest is considered to have succeeded despite Agravaine playing their Fail card, Agravaine may declare to cause it to fail anyway. Situations where this is relevant are when a single Reversal is played, the mission requires 2 Fails, or Agravaine is targeted by the removal option of Strong Inquisition. 

#### Colgrevance 
Colgrevance is an Evil role that can be present in games with 10 players. Colgrevance knows, precisely, the roles of all other Evil characters in the game. Thus, Colgrevane will be told not only who else is Evil, but which Evil role they possess. To balance this, other Evil players do not know who they are initially, and must figure it out during the course of the game. 

Colgrevance only appears in games with at least 10 players. 

### Neutral 
The goal of Neutral roles depends on the role. Currently, the two neutral roles are guaranteed to appear in 9 player games, and will not appear in any other game. (Note that these roles are currently not playtested, and thus may be hilariously unbalanced). 

#### Pelinor 
Pelinor's goal is to find the Questing Beast, and then ideally go on a Quest with them. Pelinor can win in one of three ways. 

1) There are no Questing Beast Was Here cards played at any point in the game. 
2) Pelinor is on a Quest where a Questing Beast Was Here card is also played, and 3 Quests succeed. 
3) If the only Questing Beast Was Here card was played on the final Quest of the game (e.g. at the same time that three missions had now succeeded or three missions had failed), Pelinor declares (before any other post-game rounds) and chooses one person they believe to be the Questing Beast. After all other post-game rounds are completed (after Redemption and/or Assassination), the person Pelinor has chosen informs Pelinor of whether they were correct or not. Pelinor wins if they were correct, and loses if they were incorrect. 

#### The Questing Beast
The Questing Beast's goal is to make their presence known, and then to evade Pelinor for the rest of the game. The Questing Beast is told which player is Pelinor prior to the beginning of the game. Furthermore, to make their presence more conspicuous, the Questing Beast must play Questing Beast Was Here cards whenever they are sent on a Quest. Once per game, the Questing Beast can choose to play a Success instead of a Questing Beast Was Here card, in order to throw Pelinor off their trail. 

The Questing Beast wins if all three of these conditions are true: 

1) At least one Questing Beast Was Here card is played at any point in the game. 
2) Either a) Pelinor is never on a mission where a Questing Beast Was Here card is played; or b) 3 Quests fail. 
3) Pelinor fails to identify the Questing Beast at the end of the game. (Note that Pelinor cannot attempt to guess the Questing Beast unless the only Questing Beast Was Here card was played on the last Quest of the game.)
