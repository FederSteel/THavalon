# THavalon
An extended ruleset for the Resistance: Avalon 

## Roles

### Good (Loyal Servants of Arthur) 
The goal of Good players is to have three missions succeed, and then have Merlin and the Lovers survive the Assassination round. 

#### Merlin 
Merlin's role is largely unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They are shown a list of players with Evil roles, as detailed below. 

- Merlin correctly sees players with the following Evil roles as Evil: Maelegant, Morgana, Agravaine, Colgrevance, Oberon. 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Good roles as Evil: Lancelot 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Evil role as Good: Mordred 

Merlin is a valid target for Assassination. 

#### Percival
Percival's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They know which players have the Merlin or Morgana roles, but not which role is possessed by each player. 

- Percival correctly sees Merlin as Merlin
- Percival incorrectly sees Morgana as Merlin 

#### Tristan and Iseult 
Tristan and Iseult ("The Lovers") are two Good roles that provide their associated players with the knowledge that the other is also Good. 

The Lovers are a valid target for Assassination.  

#### Guinevere and Lancelot
Guinevere and Lancelot (commonly referred to as "weak lovers") are two Good roles that provide their associated players with knowledge about both the other person and Maelegant (an Evil role). To make matters worse, Merlin will incorrectly perceive Lancelot as Evil. 

- Guinevere sees Maelegant and Lancelot.
- Lancelot sees Maelegant and Guinvere, and is also perceived to be Evil by Merlin. 

#### Arthur 
Arthur is the only Good character to possess an activated ability. Arthur knows which other good roles are present in the game, but has no information about which players possess any of the roles present. Furthermore, Arthur has an ability, called Redemption, which allows Good one final chance at victory. 

##### Ability: Redemption 
If three of the first four missions fail, the player who has the Arthur role may formally declare as Arthur. You may, after consulting the other players, attempt to identify all evil players in the game. If you are correct, then the assassination round occurs as if three missions had succeeded; should the evil team fail to assassinate a viable target, the good team wins.

### Evil (Minions of Mordred) 
The goal of Evil players is to have either three missions fail, or should Good have won, assassinate either Merlin or the Lovers. 

#### Mordred
Mordred's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. Mordred knows most of the other Evil team members, but is not seen by Merlin. 

- Mordred correctly sees Agravaine, Colgrevance, Maelegant, and Morgana as Evil 
- Mordred is not aware of Oberon
- Mordred is incorrectly seen by Merlin as Good 

#### Morgana 
Morgana's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. Morgana knows most of the other Evil team members, but is also seen incorrectly by Percival as Merlin. 

- Morgana correctly sees Agravaine, Colgrevance, Maelegant, and Mordred as Evil 
- Morgana is not aware of Oberon
- Morgana is incorrectly seen by Percival as Merlin 

#### Maelegant 
Maelegant is an Evil role that exists to confuse Lancelot and Guinevere. To counterbalance that several good characters have information about them, Maelegant will know which player is Mordred (assuming there is a Mordred present). 

#### Oberon 
Oberon's role is significantly changed from the base rules of Avalon. Oberon is an Evil role that can be present in games with 7 or more players. Oberon knows who else is Evil, but other Evil players do not generally know who Oberon is, although they will know that there is an Oberon (by the lack of a visible Evil character).  

- Oberon correctly sees Agravaine, Colgrevance, Maelegant, Mordred, and Morgana as Evil
- Oberon is not seen by other Evil characters. 
- Oberon is correctly seen by Merlin as Evil 
- Oberon must play a Fail card whenever they are sent on a mission. 

To counteract these significant drawbacks, Oberon posseses a unique ability, Betrayal. 

##### Ability: Betrayal 
After the cards from the 4th mission have been revealed, Oberon may formally declare as Oberon and cause the mission to fail, even if it would have succeeded. This ability is only usable if Oberon was on the 4th mission team. 

#### Agravaine 
Agravaine is an Evil role that can be present in games with 7 or more players. In addition to knowing the other visible Evil roles (e.g. all Evil except Oberon), Agravaine also knows which Assassination targets are present in the game. 

- Agravaine correctly sees Colgrevance, Maelegant, Mordred, and Morgana as Evil 
- Agravaine knows if there is a Merlin in the game
- Agravaine knows if both Tristan and Iseult are in the game 

#### Colgrevane 
Colgrevance is an Evil role that can be present in games with 10 players. Colgrevance knows, precisely, the roles of all other Evil characters in the game. Thus, Colgrevane will be told not only who else is Evil, but which Evil role they possess. Note that Colgrevane *does* know who Oberon is, if Oberon is present in the game.
