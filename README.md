# THavalon
An extended ruleset for the Resistance: Avalon, primarily developed by me (Andrew Hitt/aquadrizzt), with help and extensive play-testing from Technology House, Inc. 

## What is THavalon? 
THavalon is a massive extension of the rules presented in Don Eskridge's social deception game, The Resistance: Avalon. The main point of THavalon is to provide every player of the game with a role and that to ensure every player in the game feels like they can make an impact on the result of the game. Over time, these rules have evolved in an effort to make the game both faster and more fun, as well as to fix some of the playstyles that have been established in our own metagame. 

While you are welcome to pick and choose from the new rules, abilities, and roles listed below, the game is balanced under the assumption that you are using all of these rules simultaneously. However, at the end of the day, you're playing a board game to have fun (hopefully), so feel free to use these rules in whatever way you think would enhance you and your gaming group's experience. 

Comments, criticisms, ideas, and suggestions are all always welcome. I'd love to hear any feedback that people have to offer. 

## New Rules 
These rules are in addition to the rules presented in the official rulebook. If a rule here and a rule in the rulebook are contradictory, use the rules here. 

### Team Building Phase 
These rule changes are designed to speed up the game and to encourage more thoughtful choices about Approving or Rejecting a mission proposal. 

#### Proposals per Round
The number of proposals in each Round is now equal to one more than the number of Evil roles in the game. 

- In 5 and 6 player games, there will be 3 proposals per round. 
- In 7, 8, and 9 player games, there will be 4 proposals per round. 
- In 10 player games, there will be 5 proposals per round. 

#### Force
The last proposal of a round is no longer voted on; the Leader may choose any Team they want, and that Team is automatically considered to have been approved, as if by a majority of players voting Approve. (This replaces the rule where Evil wins if five Teams are rejected in a single round.) 

#### Inquisition
Inquisition is a new mechanic to encourage players to consider voting for earlier proposals in a round. Inquisition has two varieties: "Strong", and "Weak". Both Strong and Weak Inquisition provide the Leader of the Team with powerful information gathering abilities during the Quest Phase. 

When Inquisition is in effect, players on the Team select the Quest card they wish to play and place it face down in front of them (or another way of signalling that their decision has been made), but the cards are not immediately shuffled together. 

In the case of Strong Inqusition, which only happens should a majority of players vote Approve for the first Team proposal of a Round with 5 Team proposals (e.g. only in 10 player games if using all other rules presented here). Strong Inquisition requires the Leader to choose between two options: 1) remove a player's card but not reveal it, or 2) reveal a player's card. All other Quest cards are then shuffled together and revealed as per usual.  

Weak Inquisition only happens if 1) a majority of players vote Approve for the second Team proposal of a Round with 5 Team proposals, or 2) a majority of players vote Approve for the first Team proposal of a Round with 4 Team proposals. Weak Inquisition requires the Leader to choose a player's card to reveal. All other Quest cards are then shuffled together and revealed as per usual.  

Cards that are revealed but not removed by either Inquisition effect still affect the results of the mission. The Leader is allowed to use Inquisition on their own Quest card if they so desire, but they must use the ability (e.g. the Leader cannot choose to not use Inquisition if it has been earned). 

Strong Inquisition and Weak Inquisition can each only occur once per game. If Strong Inquisition has already been used that game, and the first Team proposal of a Round is sent (which would normally earn Strong Inquisition), the Leader is considered to have gained the Weak Inquisition ability instead.

### Quest Phase 
There are only two changes to the Quest Phase, one of which is explained in the Inquisition section (under Team Building Phase, above). 

#### Reversal 
In most games of THavalon, players who are sent on Quests will receive three Quest cards instead of two. The additional card is a Reversal, and is only playable by players who have the Lancelot and Maelegant roles. 

When played, a Reversal inverts the result of the mission. Two Reversals cancel each other out. If there is at least one Fail card played along with a single Reversal, the mission is considered to have succeeded. If there are no Fail cards and a single Reversal, the mission is considered to have failed. 

For Quests that require 2 Fails to be considered a failed Quest, there is a slight caveat as explained below. In most cases, a Reversal on a 2-Fails-required Quests behaves as expected, excluding the circumstance in which a single Reversal is played with no Fail cards (which would be expected to count as a Fail). 

- If a single Reversal and no Fails are played, the Quest is considered to have *succeeded*.  
- If a single Reversal and a single Fail are both played, the Quest is considered to have failed. 
- If a single Reversal and two or more Fails are played, the Quest is considered to have succeeded. 

#### Questing Beast Was Here 
In 9 player games, there are two roles added, one of which has its own Quest card. The player assigned the Questing Beast role in the game is required to play "Questing Beast Was Here" cards whenever they are sent on missions; they may not play any other Quest card. This is to aid the player with the Pelinor role in identifying the Questing Beast. Other than being conspicuous, Questing Beast Was Here cards function identically to Success cards in terms of mission results. 

### Assassination Phase 
The Assassination Phase remains largely unchanged, but there are several new options for Evil to choose from when identifying the person(s) they wish to Assassinate. Should the Good team fulfill any of their win conditions, the Evil team is allowed to choose one of the following three Assassination options.

- Assassinating a single person as Merlin. 
- Assassinating two people as the Lovers (Tristan and Iseult). 
- Assassinating no one. 

Evil is welcome to discuss amongst themselves, but at the end of discussion, the ranking Assassin (e.g. the person who appears first in this list: Mordred, Morgana, Maelegant, Agravaine, Colgrevance, Oberon) makes the final decision of who to Assassinate. 

Evil is considered to have won if they correctly identify Merlin, they correctly identify both of the two Lovers, or they choose to assassinate no one and there is neither a Merlin nor a pair of Lovers in the game.


## Roles

### Good (Loyal Servants of Arthur) 
The goal of Good players is to have three missions succeed, and then have Merlin and the Lovers survive the Assassination round. 

#### Merlin 
Merlin's role is largely unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They are shown a list of players with Evil roles, as detailed below. 

- Merlin correctly sees players with the following Evil roles as Evil: Maelegant, Morgana, Agravaine, Colgrevance, Oberon. 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Good roles as Evil: Lancelot 
- Merlin incorrectly sees players with the following Evil role as Good: Mordred 

Merlin is a valid target for Assassination. 

#### Percival
Percival's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. They know which players have the Merlin or Morgana roles, but not which role is possessed by each player. 

- Percival correctly sees Merlin as Merlin
- Percival incorrectly sees Morgana as Merlin 

#### Tristan and Iseult 
Tristan and Iseult ("The Lovers") are two Good roles that provide their associated players with the knowledge that the other is also Good. 

The Lovers are a valid target for Assassination.  

#### Guinevere and Lancelot
Guinevere and Lancelot (commonly referred to as "weak lovers") are two Good roles that provide their associated players with knowledge about both the other person and Maelegant (an Evil role). To make matters worse, Merlin will incorrectly perceive Lancelot as Evil. 

- Guinevere sees Maelegant and Lancelot.
- Lancelot sees Maelegant and Guinvere, and is also perceived to be Evil by Merlin. 

#### Arthur 
Arthur is the only Good character to possess an activated ability. Arthur knows which other good roles are present in the game, but has no information about which players possess any of the roles present. Furthermore, Arthur has an ability, called Redemption, which allows Good one final chance at victory. 

##### Ability: Redemption 
If three of the first four missions fail, the player who has the Arthur role may formally declare as Arthur. You may, after consulting the other players, attempt to identify all evil players in the game. If you are correct, then the assassination round occurs as if three missions had succeeded; should the evil team fail to assassinate a viable target, the good team wins.

### Evil (Minions of Mordred) 
The goal of Evil players is to have either three missions fail, or should Good have won, assassinate either Merlin or the Lovers. 

#### Mordred
Mordred's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. Mordred knows most of the other Evil team members, but is not seen by Merlin. 

- Mordred correctly sees Agravaine, Colgrevance, Maelegant, and Morgana as Evil 
- Mordred is not aware of Oberon
- Mordred is incorrectly seen by Merlin as Good 

#### Morgana 
Morgana's role is unchanged from the base rules of Avalon. Morgana knows most of the other Evil team members, but is also seen incorrectly by Percival as Merlin. 

- Morgana correctly sees Agravaine, Colgrevance, Maelegant, and Mordred as Evil 
- Morgana is not aware of Oberon
- Morgana is incorrectly seen by Percival as Merlin 

#### Maelegant 
Maelegant is an Evil role that exists to confuse Lancelot and Guinevere. To counterbalance that several good characters have information about them, Maelegant will know which player is Mordred (assuming there is a Mordred present). 

#### Oberon 
Oberon's role is significantly changed from the base rules of Avalon. Oberon is an Evil role that can be present in games with 7 or more players; however, Oberon cannot present in 9 player games. Oberon knows who else is Evil, but other Evil players do not generally know who Oberon is, although they will know that there is an Oberon (by the lack of a visible Evil character). Oberon also knows which Assassination targets are present in the game.

- Oberon correctly sees Agravaine, Colgrevance, Maelegant, Mordred, and Morgana as Evil
- Oberon is not seen by other Evil characters. 
- Oberon is correctly seen by Merlin as Evil 
- Oberon knows if there is a Merlin in the game
- Oberon knows if both Tristan and Iseult are in the game 

#### Agravaine 
Agravaine is an Evil role that can be present in games with 7 or more players. In addition to knowing the other visible Evil roles (e.g. all Evil except Oberon), Agravaine may single-handedly fail the fourth mission, via the Betrayal ability. 

- Agravaine correctly sees Colgrevance, Maelegant, Mordred, and Morgana as Evil 
- Agravaine must play a Fail card whenever they are sent on a mission. 

To counteract these significant drawbacks, Oberon posseses a unique ability, Betrayal. 

##### Ability: Betrayal 
After the cards from the 4th mission have been revealed, Oberon may formally declare as Oberon and cause the mission to fail, even if it would have succeeded. This ability is only usable if Oberon was on the 4th mission team. 

#### Colgrevane 
Colgrevance is an Evil role that can be present in games with 10 players. Colgrevance knows, precisely, the roles of all other Evil characters in the game. Thus, Colgrevane will be told not only who else is Evil, but which Evil role they possess. Note that Colgrevane *does* know who Oberon is, if Oberon is present in the game.
